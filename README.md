# Homepage for CSE/CIS Peer Mentors @ OSU
We are a student organization on campus, and we work closely with the CSE advisors to coordinate the program. Our organization provides sophomores, juniors, and seniors with the opportunity to serve as a resource for first-year students during the survey class.
